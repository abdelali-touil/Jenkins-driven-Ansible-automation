CI/CD pipeline leveraging Jenkins for orchestration and Ansible for configuration management. 

The project implements a CI/CD pipeline that utilizes Jenkins for orchestration and Ansible for configuration management. The repository provides resources and instructions for automating deployment workflows using these tools.

## Features

- Automated deployment workflows using Jenkins pipelines
- Infrastructure provisioning and configuration with Ansible
- Modular and reusable playbooks
- Example Jenkinsfiles for common CI/CD tasks
- Integration with version control systems (e.g., Git)

## Prerequisites

- Jenkins installed and configured
- Ansible installed on the Jenkins host or agent
- Access to target infrastructure (e.g., SSH keys, inventory files)
- Git for source code management

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Jenkins-driven-Ansible-automation.git
    cd Jenkins-driven-Ansible-automation
    ```

2. **Configure Jenkins:**
    - Create a new Jenkins pipeline job.
    - Use the provided `Jenkinsfile` as the pipeline definition.
    - Set up credentials and environment variables as needed.

3. **Set up Ansible:**
